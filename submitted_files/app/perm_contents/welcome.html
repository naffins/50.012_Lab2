        <h1>Development Image Board Server</h1>
        <p>
            This REST API server + Redis implementation allows for the posting of images with an inbuilt simple contributors (users) system.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Contributor management system</h3>
        <p>
            The contributor system lists all current contributors of the image board. Users must be registered to modify or post new images.
            <br><br>
            To view all contributors, GET /contributors. Several query parameters are available:
            - sortBy: sorts returned users. Only acceptable inputs are "username" and "name"
            - count: number of users to return in post-sorted list (if sorting is done), after offset (if any)
            - offset: number of users to skip in post-sorted list
            <br><br>
            To add a new contributor, POST to /contributors info in the following format:
            {
                "username": string of 3-20 characters that are alphanumeric or underscore,
                "name": string of 3-30 characters that are alphanumeric or space,
                "bio": string
            }
            This creates a new contributor, or updates the contributor's info if it already exists.
            <br><br>
            To view a specific existing contributor's info, GET /contributors/[contributor's username].

            To update an existing contributor's info, PUT to /contributors/[contributor's username], in the following format:
            {
                "username": string of 3-20 characters that are alphanumeric or underscore,
                "name": string of 3-30 characters that are alphanumeric or space,
                "bio": string
            }
            This updates the contributor's info.
            <br><br>
            To delete an existing contributor, DELETE /contributors/[contributor's username].
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Image management system</h3>
        <p>
            The image system stores images which are for public viewing.
            <br><br>
            To add a new image, POST to /images with:
            - a PNG image under the "file" key
            - a username under the "username" key
            as form data. Note that only valid PNG images are accepted for now, and that users must be currently registered.
            <br><br>
            To view an image, GET /images/[image's identifier].
            <br><br>
            To update an image, PUT to /images/[image's identifier] with the same format as for adding new images.
            <br><br>
            To delete an image, DELETE /images/[image's identifier].
        </p>
